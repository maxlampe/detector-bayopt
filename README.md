# detector-bayopt

Bayesian optimization for experimental design with Gaussian Processes used on the example case of detector response.
This repository is complementary material to the publication 
_"Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization for High Precision Experiments"_
[[Lamparth et al.]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07625).

The Gaussian process regression for the temperature correction of the detectors is 
available in the [panter](https://github.com/maxlampe/panter) analysis framework 
in the _panter.eval.evalDriftGPR.GPRDrift_ class.
